Usage:

To install tdm for your local user, run tdmctl init

tdmctl add <session name> <executable path> [X(default)/extra]

This will copy the tdm configuration directory to your home directory.

You must then edit your .profile (or .bash_profile, .zprofile, etc...) file to call tdm as last command (this will launch tdm once you log into a tty). If you want to allow multiple X sessions, you must use the --disable-xrunning-check option.

In your .xinitrc file, you must then replace the exec line with exec tdm --xstart, which will start your X session (if you do not have a .xinitrc file, create a new one with this line in it).

If you want to launch Xfce, you can find in this CRUX repository, I put on .xinitrc exec ck-launch-session tdm --xstart.
