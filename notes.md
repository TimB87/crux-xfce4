INSTALLING CRUX
=====
Some notes for my use about installing CRUX (3.5) in my current laptop (MacBook White Mid 2009)

BEAR IN MIND
=====
1. Download ISO from [CRUX Website](https://crux.nu/Main/Download)
2. Also I need the Wifi driver:
      FWCutter -> [Instructions](http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43/#Other_distributions_not_mentioned_above) Maybe a package for fwcutter would be more easy.
